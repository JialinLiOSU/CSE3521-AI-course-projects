  /***Your code for A* search here***/
  
  /*
    Hint: A* is very similar to BFS, you should only need to make a few small modifications to your BFS code.
	
    You will need to add values to your augmented state for path cost and estimated total cost.
    I suggest you use the member name "estimated_total_cost" so that the above priority queue code will work.
    
    Call function calculate_heuristic(state) (provided for you) to calculate the heuristic value for you.
	
    See (included) FastPriorityQueue.js for priority queue usage example.
