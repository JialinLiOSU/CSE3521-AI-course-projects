  * Give a positive score for wins, negative for losses.
  * Give larger scores for winning quickly or losing slowly
  * For example:
  *   Give a large, positive score if the player had a fast win (i.e., 5 if it only took 5 moves to win)
  *   Give a small, positive score if the player had a slow win (i.e., 1 if it took all 9 moves to win)
  *   Give a small, negative score if the player had a slow loss (i.e., -1 if it took all 9 moves to lose)
  *   Give a large, negative score if the player had a fast loss (i.e., -5 if it only took 5 moves to lose)
  * (DO NOT simply hard code the above 4 values, other scores are possible. Calculate the score based on the above pattern.)
  * (You may return either 0 or null if the game isn't finished, but this function should never be called in that case anyways.)
